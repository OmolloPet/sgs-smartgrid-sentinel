# Technical Roadmap – SmartGrid Sentinel (SGS)

## Current Status (January 2026)
- Streamlit dashboard with LSTM prediction and anomaly detection
- Attack simulation (spike, drop, noise)
- Basic repo setup with README

## Milestones to Finals (March 2026)
- Feb 1–15: Integrate real Kaggle/IEEE datasets, aim >95% accuracy
- Feb 16–28: Add explainable alerts, run red-team tests
- Mar 1–10: Polish UI, create demo video/GIF, deploy to Streamlit Cloud
- Mar 10–15: Final bug fixes & presentation prep

## Risks & Mitigation
- Data access: Use public datasets as fallback
- Compute: Train on free Google Colab if needed

## Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- Optional GPU for faster training
